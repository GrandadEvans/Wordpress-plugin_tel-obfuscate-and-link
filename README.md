This plugin will convert telephone numbers to callable links if the user is on 
a smartphone. If the user is not on a smartphone the telephone number is 
displayed in plain text.

The text/link telephone number is then obfuscated to stop spambots intercepting
your number.

##Attributes##
The following attributes are avaiable 
* Add custom link text such as "Call Me!"
* Turn the link feature off so that just plain telephone numbers are displayed
* Turn the HTML_entities option on or off
* Turn noscript on or off
* Add a custom noscript message
