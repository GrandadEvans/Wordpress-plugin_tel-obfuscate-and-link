Link to telephone numbers is the user is on a smartphone or leave plain text if
not and then obfuscate the text/link

== Description ==

#General#
This plugin will convert telephone numbers to callable links if the user is on 
a smartphone. If the user is not on a smartphone the telephone number is 
displayed in plain text.

The text/link telephone number is then obfuscated to stop spambots intercepting
your number.

##Options##
The following options are avaiable 
* Add custom link text such as "Call Me!"
* Turn the link feature off so that just plain telephone numbers are displayed*
* Turn the HTML_entities option on or off
* This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).
* Turn noscript on or off
* Add a custom noscript message
