Link to telephone numbers if the user is on a smartphone or leave plain text if
not and then obfuscate the text/link

== Description ==

This plugin will convert telephone numbers to callable links if the user is on 
a smartphone. If the user is not on a smartphone the telephone number is 
displayed in plain text. The text/link telephone number is then obfuscated to
reduce the risk of spambots intercepting your number.

The following options are avaiable 
- Add custom link text such as "Call Me!"<br />
- Turn the link feature off so that just plain telephone numbers are
  displayed<br />
- Turn the HTML_entities option on or off<br />
- Turn noscript on or off<br />
- Add a custom noscript message

== Installation ==
To use this plugin you can:<br />
1. Upload the plugin folder to your "wp-content/plugins/" folder<br />
2. Search from within the plugin screen in your admin pages for "GE's Link/Obfuscate Phone Numbers"<br />
You should then activate the plugin from within the plugin admin screen

To use the plugin place the shortcode [link_and_obfuscate_telephone_number] where you want your code to appear. Inside the shortcode should be a minimum
of a "tel" tag containing the telephone number you wish to act upon. Other options available are:<br />

tel --> The number to you want to action<br />
link --> enter link="0" to disable links<br />
debug --> debug="1" will output debugging information<br />
link_text --> Will change the link text eg link="Call Me"<br />
use_noscript_fallback --> Turn off the <noscript> message<br />
noscript_message --> customise the noscript message<br />

Simple example
[link_and_obfuscate_telephone_number tel="1234567890]

Advanced example with all options set
[link_and_obfuscate_telephone_number
    tel="1234567890                   <-- This is the only required tag<br />
    link="1"                          <-- change to 0 to turn linking off<br />
    debug="0"                         <-- Change to 1 to turn debugging on<br />
    link_text="Call Me"               <-- default is the telephone number<br />
    use_noscript_fallback="1"         <-- set to 0 to turn off JS fallback<br />
    noscript_message="JS not enabled" <-- shows if Javascript not enabled<br />

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I obfuscate telephone numbers? =
Telephone numbers are as succeptable to spambots as emails are and it makes
perfect sense to obfuscate telephone numbers if you are obfuscating email
addresses

= Why create links on smartphones? =
Modern Smartphones are capable of recognising tel: links that can take the
referenced telephone number and place a call to it, therefore saving you the
trouble of writing a telephone number down on one screen to switch to the
dialler and enter it in there.
